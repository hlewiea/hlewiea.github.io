File storage
To open your WSL project in Windows File Explorer, enter: explorer.exe .
Be sure to add the period at the end of the command to open the current directory.

Store your project files on the same operating system as the tools you plan to use.
For the fastest performance speed, store your files in the WSL file system if you are working on them with Linux tools in a Linux command line (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc). If you're working in a Windows command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt) with Windows tools, store your files in the Windows file system. Files can be accessed across the operating systems, but it may significantly slow down performance.

For example, when storing your WSL project files:

Use the Linux file system root directory: \\wsl$\<DistroName>\home\<UserName>\Project
Not the Windows file system root directory: C:\Users\<UserName>\Project or /mnt/c/Users/<UserName>/Project$


vpn in ubuntu
question: ubuntu(not wsl), i can use vpn using shadowsocks gui, but it not works in terminal
solution: 
    - config http_proxy in .bashrc or zshrc, the port is the same as configured in gui
    - install proxychains, config /etc/proxychain.conf file, with HTTP 127.0.0.1:port in proxyList
